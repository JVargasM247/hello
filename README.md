- computed properties are only for transforming data for our presentation layer. They should not alter or change the existing data.
- To avoid that we ca use a spread operator to make a copy o clone of the array. The spread operator is used to make copies of a js object
- Accidetaly changing or mutating an underlyig data value in a computed property is big source of bugs. 
- When you need to change data,you will use methods. When you need to change the presentation of existing data,you'll use computed properties.
